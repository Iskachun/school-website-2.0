                    <li>I added (finally) the draft for the main page. It is currently in the photos project, but I feel like there should be some better place for it somewhere else.</li>
                    <li>I removed the draft for the main page, instead putting it in the end of this log. I think that's a more logical place to have it.</li>
                    <li>I worked a bit more with keeping the page responsive (had some problems with the picture being too wide on my phone), and I started thinking - I should change the look on the main page a bit. If you look at it from a desktop, you'll see that the log is quite long, making the other sections filled with empty space (which is boring) + more scrolling. But at the same time I still want to keep it.</li>
